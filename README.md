# learning-python-hangman
simple hangman game

Requirement:
1 or 2 players mode
Find a large list of dictionary words and embedding them in your application. When the game starts, the user should be prompted to choose between 1-player or 2-player mode.
In 2 players mode, The game should start by prompting player 1 to pick a word. Then the screen should clear itself so that player 2 can't see the word.
The "gallows" and the empty letter spaces should be drawn, and the player should be allowed to guess letters until they either win, or lose. As they choose correct letters, the letters should appear on the screen in place of the blank space (clear and redraw the whole screen). As they choose wrong letters, the "man" himself should come end up being drawn, piece by piece. How many guesses they get before losing is up to you (depending on how complicated of a man you want to draw).
